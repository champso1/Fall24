\section{(6.8)}


We did this one in class!


\begin{parts}
\item First,
  \begin{equation}
    \Braket{f | \hat\Pi | g} = \intinf f^*(x) g(-x) \; \ddx.
  \end{equation}

  Taking $x \rightarrow -x$:

  \begin{equation}
    = \int_{\infty}^{-\infty} f^*(-x) g(x) \;(-\dd x) = \intinf f^*(-x) g(x) \;\dd x = \Braket{f | \hat{\Pi}^\dagger | g},
  \end{equation}

  so $\boxed{\hat\Pi^\dagger = \hat\Pi.}$



\item As a unitary operator, we have that
  \begin{equation}
    \hat\Pi^\dagger\hat\Pi \, \psi = \abs{\lambda}^2 \psi = \psi,
  \end{equation}

  where the second expression follows from applying the operators to the wavefunction and getting the eigenvalues and the third follows from the unitarity of the parity operator rendering $\hat\Pi^\dagger\hat\Pi = 1$. Now, since the parity operator is also Hermitian, it means that its eigenvalues must also be real, so it must be that $\lambda^2 = 1$, meaning $\lambda = 1$ or -1.
