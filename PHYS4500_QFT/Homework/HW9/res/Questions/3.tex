% show that in n-dim, \gamma^{\mu}\gamma_{\mu} = n.
\section{}

We are to show that 

\begin{equation}
    \gamma^{\mu}\gamma_{\mu} = n
\end{equation}

in $n$ dimensions. First:

\begin{equation*}
    \gamma^{\mu}\gamma_{\mu} = g_{\mu\nu}\gamma^{\mu}\gamma^{\nu} = g_{\mu\nu}\br{\{\gamma^{\mu}, \gamma^{\nu}\} - \gamma^{\nu}\gamma^{\mu}}.
\end{equation*}

The anti-commutator of the gamma matrices is independent of the dimension - it's just $2g^{\mu\nu}$, so

\begin{align*}
    \gamma^{\mu}\gamma_{\mu} &= g_{\mu\nu}\br{2g^{\mu\nu} - \gamma^{\nu}\gamma^{\mu}} = 2g_{\mu\nu}g^{\mu\nu} - \gamma^{\mu}\gamma_{\mu} \\
    2\gamma^{\mu}\gamma_{\mu} &= 2g_{\mu}^{\mu} \\
    \gamma^{\mu}\gamma_{\mu} &= n.
\end{align*}
